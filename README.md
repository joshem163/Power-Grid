# Overview
MP-Grid is an innovative machine learning model for outage detection in smart grid using multi-peremeters persistent homology. This repository contains the code for the MP-Grid paper. The following files contain different codes coresponding to the dataset used for the experiment in this paper. To execute the code, begin by downloading the dataset and updating the file paths accordingly.

**37Bus.ipynb:** 37 Bus Network, **Bus123SuperLevel.ipynb:** 123 Bus Network, **Bus342SuperLevel.ipynb:** 342 Bus LVN, **Super8500.ipynb:** 8500 Bus Network, **SanMulti.py:** for San fransisco dataset, **Feature_SanMulti.zip:** This is the output file generated by "SanMulti.py", **SanfranciscoMulti.ipynb:** ML task for Sanfransisco dataset generated by "SanMulti.py" is performed here. 
# Requirements
1. networkx 3.1
2. Pyflagser
3. sklearn 1.3.0
4. xgboost 2.0.1
# Datasets
 Three small datasets (37 BUs, 123 BUS, and 342 BUS) and two big datasets (8500 BUS and Sanfransisco ) have been used in this experiment.
 
# Runing the Experiments
1. Execute all cell of notebook to run the experiment:
2. Make sure to maintain the sequential order of execution as specified in the code.
3. Follow the prompts or instructions provided by the code to proceed with the experiment.
4. For Sanfransisco datasets, the final feature vectors will be saved as CSV files in the same directory for future.
